 * a) f(x) = x^2 + 1
 * b) f(x) = {2|x| + 1 if x < 0 and 2|x| + 2 if x >= 0}
 * c) f(x) = |x| + 1
 * d) f(x) = {2|x| + 1 if x <= 0 and 2|x| if x > 0}
 *
 * Q4)
 * a) Proof: For two real numbers a and b, assume a is rational and ab is irrational, then b is also rational.
 * Since a and b is rational,  a = x / y and b = u / v (x,y,u, v are 4 integers and y != 0 and v != 0)
 * Multiplying both terms --> a * b = (x/y) * (u/v) = xu / yv
 * Here, Since x,y,u, v are integers, (y*u) and (y*v) are also integers and (y*v) is != 0 since y !=0 and v != 0
 * Therefore a*b is also rational which contradicts our assumption that a*b is irrational. Therefore b cannot be rational []
 *
 * b) Proof: Assume k is even and show that 3k + 1 is odd.
 * Since k is even, k = 2m (for some integer m)
 * Sub in 3k + 1 --> 3 * (2m) + 1
 * = 6m + 1
 * = 2 * (3m) + 1
 * = 2 * r + 1
 * Since m is an integer r = 3m is also an integer. Since 3k + 1 = 2r + 1 for some integer r, 2k + 1 is odd. []
 *
 * c) Proof: Assume x and y are two odd integers and show that x + y is even.
 * Since x and y are odd,
 * x = 2k + 1 (for some integer k)
 * y = 2m + 1 (for some integer m)
 * Adding both,
 * x + y = 2k + 1 + 2m + 1
 *       = 2k + 2m + 2
 *       = 2(k + m + 1)
 *       = 2r
 *    Since k and m are integers r = k + m + 1 is also an integer. Since x + y = 2r and r is an integer, x + y is even.[]
